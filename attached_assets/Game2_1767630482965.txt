This app is a game simulation, not real trading.
Do NOT generate prices randomly on screen load.
ALL prices, user holdings, and bot actions must be saved and loaded from files inside the Git repository.
1. App Concept
Build an Android app that simulates a Movie Stock Market Game.
Movies behave like stocks
Users trade using virtual coins only
No real money
No withdrawal
Skill-based gameplay
2. Screens (MANDATORY)
The app must have exactly these screens:
1️⃣ Market Screen
Shows list of movies
Each movie card shows:
Movie name
Release year
Market status:
Market Open
Trading Live
Market Closed
Current price (virtual)
BUY button
⚠️ NO SELL button on Market screen
2️⃣ Portfolio Screen (MOST IMPORTANT)
This screen enables SELL.
For each movie user owns, show:
Movie name
Quantity owned
Buy price
Current price
Profit / Loss
SELL button
SELL must:
Reduce holdings
Add coins back to user
Update stored data file
3️⃣ Leaderboard Screen
Mix of:
Real users
AI Traders (clearly marked)
Show:
Rank
Coins
Accuracy %
4️⃣ Profile Screen
Total coins
Trades done
Accuracy
Rank
Disclaimer text
3. DATA PERSISTENCE (CRITICAL – NO RESET BUG)
All game state must be stored in files inside the Git repo.
Use simple file storage like:
JSON files
Text files
Example files:
Copy code

/data/movies.json
/data/prices.json
/data/user_portfolio.json
/data/bots.json
4. GOLDEN RULE (DO NOT BREAK)
❌ Never generate prices on UI load
❌ Never reset values when app restarts
✅ Always:
Load data from files on app start
Update files after every BUY or SELL
Logic:
Copy code

If data exists in file → load it
If not → create once and save
5. Movie Rules (Very Important)
Movies must be filtered like this:
UPCOMING
Release date in future
Status: Market Open
BUY allowed
SELL allowed (if user owns)
RUNNING
Released within last 14 days
Status: Trading Live
BUY + SELL allowed
CLOSED
Old movies
Status: Market Closed
❌ BUY disabled
❌ SELL disabled
Old movies must NOT be tradable.
6. BUY Logic (Simple)
When user presses BUY:
Deduct coins
Add movie to portfolio
Save updated portfolio to file
Save updated coin balance
7. SELL Logic (Critical)
When user presses SELL:
Reduce quantity
Add coins back
Update portfolio file
Update coin file
Recalculate profit / loss
8. Price Movement (Safe Simulation)
Prices must change slowly based on:
Buy vs sell pressure
AI trader activity
Rules:
No sudden resets
No full random jumps
Small up/down movements only
Price must persist across app restarts
9. AI TRADERS (NPCs – CLEARLY LABELED)
Add 1000+ AI Traders.
AI traders must:
Be clearly marked as:
“AI Trader”
“Market Bot”
AI behavior:
Random buy/sell within limits
Uses same price data as humans
Activity stored in file
AI traders exist to:
Create volume
Keep market alive
Move prices realistically
10. Coins Rules
Free coins only
Coins have NO real value
Coins cannot be cashed out
Coins are only for ranking
11. UI FEEL
Dark theme
Green = profit
Red = loss
Smooth animations
Rank movement animations
12. Mandatory Disclaimer (Show in Profile)
“This is a skill-based movie prediction game.
All prices and results are simulated.
Virtual coins have no real-world value.
AI traders are part of the game design.”
13. FAILURE HANDLING
If:
Data source fails
Bot logic fails
Then:
Do NOT reset the game
Keep last saved values
Continue smoothly
14. PRIORITY ORDER
1️⃣ Data persistence
2️⃣ BUY + SELL working
3️⃣ Portfolio screen
4️⃣ Bots
5️⃣ UI polish
Do NOT sacrifice logic for visuals.
