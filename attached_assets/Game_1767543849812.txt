Build a mobile-first Android app that feels like a fantasy trading game.
This app simulates a movie stock market.
This is a skill-based game using virtual coins only.
1. Automation First (No Manual Work)
The system must run automatically.
Movies, prices, and results should update without human input.
If exact numbers are not available, use the best public estimate and continue the game smoothly.

Data Collection – Simple & Automatic
The app should automatically read movie performance from public internet pages.
How to do this (in simple terms):
Search the movie name + “box office collection”
Read the visible numbers shown on news pages or search summaries
Extract only:
Opening day collection
Weekend total
Overall verdict words (Hit / Flop / Average)
If different numbers appear:
Take the most commonly repeated value
Smooth sudden jumps instead of stopping the game
Important:
Data is used only for game simulation
Exact financial accuracy is NOT required

Movie Market Logic
Each movie behaves like a stock.
Trailer release → movie appears in market
Market stays open for several days
Users and AI traders can buy and sell
Market closes automatically at a fixed time
After close:
Movie performance updates automatically
Coins are redistributed
Leaderboard updates
4. AI Traders (Very Important)
Add 1000+ AI traders from day one.
These are NOT fake users. They must be clearly marked as:
“AI Trader”
“Market Bot”
“Studio Bot”
AI trader behavior:
Some are aggressive
Some are conservative
Some follow hype
Some react late
AI traders should:
Buy and sell randomly within logical limits
React to trailer hype and early box office data
Create price movement and volume
Purpose:
Keep the market alive
Create competition
Make the game feel crowded and active

Pricing & Movement
Movie price changes based on:
Buy vs sell pressure
New data updates
AI trader activity
Prices should:
Go up with positive news
Go down with bad news
Never freeze or stop
Movement should feel alive, not perfect.
6. Coin Rules (Strict)
Coins are free
Coins have NO real value
Coins cannot be cashed out
Coins are only for ranking
7. Rewards (Optional, Legal)
Monthly:
Top skill-based players
Selected by accuracy and consistency
Rewards:
Platform-sponsored promotional prizes
Not linked to coins
Not linked to losses

8. UI Feel
The app must feel:
Competitive
Fast
Exciting
Use:
Dark theme
Green for gains
Red for losses
Animated price changes
Rank jump animations
Confetti on results
9. Clear Disclaimer (Must Show)
“This app is a skill-based movie prediction game.
All data is collected from public sources and used only for gameplay simulation.
AI traders are part of the game design.
Virtual coins have no real-world value.”

10. Priority
If something fails:
Do not stop the game
Approximate and continue
Smooth errors instead of blocking users
